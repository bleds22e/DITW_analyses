## Packages and Data

Load the packages used in data cleaning and analysis.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)    # for data wrangling
library(readxl)       # read in data
library(lme4)         # for lmer()
library(lmerTest)     # for p-values in lmer
library(performance)  # for assumption checks
```

Read in the data.

```{r}
data <- readxl::read_excel("../data_raw/DataInTheWild_PrePost_ForEllen.xlsx", 
                           col_names = FALSE)
```

Remove the row with what all the questions are and save them in case we need them later.

```{r}
questions <- slice(data, 3)
data <- slice(data, -3)
```

Combine the first two rows to one row to create column names.

```{r}

```
